                        <p class="tj f7 mb2">The Spokesman-Review works with local and national foundations to help fund some of the journalism in our newspaper. What makes this partnership unique is that we are one of the only news organizations in the nation to then release the copyright of these stories publicly through Creative Commons. That means the journalism funded by our community is actually owned by our community, not by our newspaper. All of this money goes directly to offsetting the salaries of reporters in our newsroom and is tax-deductible.</p>
